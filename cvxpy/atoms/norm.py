    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Expression or numeric constant
        The value to take the norm of.  If `x` is 2D and `axis` is None,
        this function constructs a matrix norm.
    p : int or str, optional
        The type of norm. Valid options include any positive integer,
        'fro' (for frobenius), 'nuc' (sum of singular values), np.inf or
        'inf' (infinity norm).
    axis : None, int, or tuple of ints, optional
        The axis along which to apply the norm, if any. A tuple with a
        single element is equivalent to an integer axis. A tuple with two
        elements applies the corresponding matrix norm (p = 1, 2, 'fro',
        'nuc', or inf) to each slice spanned by the remaining axes, matching
        NumPy semantics. Tuples with more than two elements are not
        supported.
    keepdims: If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one.

    Returns
    -------
    Expression
        An Expression representing the norm.
