class geo_mean(Atom):
    """ The (weighted) geometric mean of vector ``x``, with optional powers given by ``p``:

    .. math::

        \\left(x_1^{p_1} \\cdots x_n^{p_n} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{\\mathbf{1}^Tp}}

    The powers ``p`` can be a ``list``, ``tuple``, or ``numpy.array`` of nonnegative
    ``int``, ``float``, or ``Fraction`` objects with nonzero sum.

    If not specified, ``p`` defaults to a vector of all ones, giving the
    **unweighted** geometric mean

    .. math::

        x_1^{1/n} \\cdots x_n^{1/n}.

    The geometric mean includes an implicit constraint that :math:`x_i \\geq 0`
    whenever :math:`p_i > 0`. If :math:`p_i = 0`, :math:`x_i` will be unconstrained.

    The only exception to this rule occurs when
    ``p`` has exactly one nonzero element, say, ``p_i``, in which case
    ``geo_mean(x, p)`` is equivalent to ``x_i`` (without the nonnegativity constraint).
    A specific case of this is when :math:`x \\in \\mathbf{R}^1`.


    .. note::

        Generally, ``p`` cannot be represented exactly, so a rational,
        i.e., fractional, **approximation** must be made.

        Internally, ``geo_mean`` immediately computes an approximate normalized
        weight vector :math:`w \\approx p/\\mathbf{1}^Tp`
        and the ``geo_mean`` atom is represented as

        .. math::

            x_1^{w_1} \\cdots x_n^{w_n},

        where the elements of ``w`` are ``Fraction`` objects that sum to exactly 1.

        The maximum denominator used in forming the rational approximation
        is given by ``max_denom``, which defaults to 1024, but can be adjusted
        to modify the accuracy of the approximations.

        The approximating ``w`` and the approximation error can be
        found through the attributes ``geo_mean.w`` and ``geo_mean.approx_error``.


    Examples
    --------

    The weights ``w`` can be seen from the string representation of the
    ``geo_mean`` object, or through the ``w`` attribute.

    >>> from cvxpy import Variable, geo_mean, Problem, Maximize
    >>> x = Variable(3, name='x')
    >>> print((geo_mean(x)))
    geo_mean(x, (1/3, 1/3, 1/3))
    >>> g = geo_mean(x, [1, 2, 1])
    >>> g.w
    (Fraction(1, 4), Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(1, 4))

    Floating point numbers with few decimal places can sometimes be represented
    exactly. The approximation error between ``w`` and ``p/sum(p)`` is given by
    the ``approx_error`` attribute.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> x = Variable(4, name='x')
    >>> p = np.array([.12, .34, .56, .78])
    >>> g = geo_mean(x, p)
    >>> g.w
    (Fraction(1, 15), Fraction(17, 90), Fraction(14, 45), Fraction(13, 30))
    >>> g.approx_error
    0.0

    In general, the approximation is not exact.

    >>> p = [.123, .456, .789, .001]
    >>> g = geo_mean(x, p)
    >>> g.w
    (Fraction(23, 256), Fraction(341, 1024), Fraction(295, 512), Fraction(1, 1024))
    >>> 1e-4 <= g.approx_error <= 1e-3
    True

    The weight vector ``p`` can contain combinations of ``int``, ``float``,
    and ``Fraction`` objects.

    >>> from fractions import Fraction
    >>> x = Variable(4, name='x')
    >>> g = geo_mean(x, [.1, Fraction(1,3), 0, 2])
    >>> print(g)
    geo_mean(x, (3/73, 10/73, 0, 60/73))
    >>> g.approx_error <= 1e-10
    True

    Sequences of ``Fraction`` and ``int`` powers can often be represented **exactly**.

    >>> p = [Fraction(1,17), Fraction(4,9), Fraction(1,3), Fraction(25,153)]
    >>> x = Variable(4, name='x')
    >>> print((geo_mean(x, p)))
    geo_mean(x, (1/17, 4/9, 1/3, 25/153))

    Terms with a zero power will not have an implicit nonnegativity constraint.

    >>> p = [1, 0, 1]
    >>> x = Variable(3, name='x')
    >>> obj = Maximize(geo_mean(x,p))
    >>> constr = [sum(x) <= 1, -1 <= x, x <= 1]
    >>> val = Problem(obj, constr).solve()
    >>> x = np.array(x.value).flatten()
    >>> print(x)
    [ 1. -1.  1.]


    Parameters
    ----------
    x : Variable
        A column or row vector whose elements we will take the geometric mean of.

    p : Sequence (list, tuple, ...) of ``int``, ``float``, or ``Fraction`` objects
        A vector of weights for the weighted geometric mean

        When ``p`` is a sequence of ``int`` and/or ``Fraction`` objects,
        ``w`` can often be an **exact** representation of the weights.
        An exact representation is sometimes possible when ``p`` has ``float``
        elements with only a few decimal places.

    max_denom : int
        The maximum denominator to use in approximating ``p/sum(p)`` with
        ``geo_mean.w``. If ``w`` is not an exact representation, increasing
        ``max_denom`` **may** offer a more accurate representation, at the
        cost of requiring more convex inequalities to represent the geometric mean.


    Attributes
    ----------
    w : tuple of ``Fractions``
        A rational approximation of ``p/sum(p)``.
    approx_error : float
        The error in approximating ``p/sum(p)`` with ``w``, given by
        :math:`\\|p/\\mathbf{1}^T p - w \\|_\\infty`
    """

    def __init__(self, x, p=None, max_denom=1024):
        """ Implementation details of geo_mean.

        Attributes
        ----------

        w_dyad : tuple of ``Fractions`` whose denominators are all a power of two
            The dyadic completion of ``w``, which is used internally to form the
            inequalities representing the geometric mean.

        tree : ``dict``
            keyed by dyadic tuples, whose values are Sequences of children.
            The children are also dyadic tuples.
            This represents the graph that needs to be formed to represent the
            weighted geometric mean.

        cone_lb : int
            A known lower bound (which is not always tight) on the number of cones
            needed to represent this geometric mean.

        cone_num_over : int
            The number of cones beyond the lower bound that this geometric mean used.
            If 0, we know that it used the minimum possible number of cones.
            Since cone_lb is not always tight, it may be using the minimum number of cones even if
            cone_num_over is not 0.

        cone_num : int
            The number of second order cones used to form this geometric mean
