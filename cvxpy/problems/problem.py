            A custom solve method to use.

            Additional solver specific arguments. See Notes below.

        Notes
        ------
        CVXPY interfaces with a wide range of solvers; the algorithms used by these solvers
        have parameters relating to stopping criteria, and strategies to improve solution quality.

        There is no one choice of parameters which is perfect for every problem. If you are not
        getting satisfactory results from a solver, you can try changing its parameters. The
        exact way this is done depends on the specific solver. Here are some examples:

            prob.solve(solver='ECOS', abstol=1e-6)
            prob.solve(solver='OSQP', max_iter=10000).
            mydict = {"MSK_DPAR_INTPNT_CO_TOL_NEAR_REL":  10}
            prob.solve(solver='MOSEK', mosek_params=mydict).

        You should refer to CVXPY's web documentation for details on how to pass solver
        parameters.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            The optimal value for the problem, or a string indicating
            why the problem could not be solved.

        Raises
        ------
        cvxpy.error.DCPError
            Raised if the problem is not DCP and `gp` is False.
        cvxpy.error.DGPError
            Raised if the problem is not DGP and `gp` is True.
        cvxpy.error.SolverError
            Raised if no suitable solver exists among the installed solvers,
            or if an unanticipated error is encountered.

    def get_problem_data(self, solver, gp=False):
        """Returns the problem data used in the call to the solver.

        When a problem is solved, CVXPY creates a chain of reductions enclosed
        in a :class:`~cvxpy.reductions.solvers.solving_chain.SolvingChain`,
        and compiles it to some low-level representation that is
        compatible with the targeted solver. This method returns that low-level
        representation.

        For some solving chains, this low-level representation is a dictionary
        that contains exactly those arguments that were supplied to the solver;
        however, for other solving chains, the data is an intermediate
        representation that is compiled even further by the solver interfaces.

        A solution to the equivalent low-level problem can be obtained via the
        data by invoking the `solve_via_data` method of the returned solving
        chain, a thin wrapper around the code external to CVXPY that further
        processes and solves the problem. Invoke the unpack_results method
        to recover a solution to the original problem.

        For example:

        ::

            objective = ...
            constraints = ...
            problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
            data, chain, inverse_data = problem.get_problem_data(cp.SCS)
            # calls SCS using `data`
            soln = chain.solve_via_data(problem, data)
            # unpacks the solution returned by SCS into `problem`
            problem.unpack_results(soln, chain, inverse_data)

        Alternatively, the `data` dictionary returned by this method
        contains enough information to bypass CVXPY and call the solver
        directly.

        For example:

        ::

            problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)
            data, _, _ = problem.get_problem_data(cp.SCS)

            import scs
            probdata = {
              'A': data['A'],
              'b': data['b'],
              'c': data['c'],
            }
            cone_dims = data['dims']
            cones = {
                "f": cone_dims.zero,
                "l": cone_dims.nonpos,
                "q": cone_dims.soc,
                "ep": cone_dims.exp,
                "s": cone_dims.psd,
            }
            soln = scs.solve(data, cones)

        The structure of the data dict that CVXPY returns depends on the
        solver. For details, consult the solver interfaces in
        `cvxpy/reductions/solvers`.

        """Compute the gradient of a solution with respect to parameters.

        This method differentiates through the solution map of the problem,
        to obtain the gradient of a solution with respect to the parameters.
        In other words, it calculates the sensitivities of the parameters
        with respect to perturbations in the optimal variable values.

        .backward() populates the .gradient attribute of each parameter as a
        side-effect. It can only be called after calling .solve() with
        `requires_grad=True`.

        Below is a simple example:

        ::

            import cvxpy as cp
            import numpy as np

            p = cp.Parameter()
            x = cp.Variable()
            quadratic = cp.square(x - 2 * p)
            problem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(quadratic), [x >= 0])
            p.value = 3.0
            problem.solve(requires_grad=True, eps=1e-10)
            # .backward() populates the .gradient attribute of the parameters
            problem.backward()
            # Because x* = 2 * p, dx*/dp = 2
            np.testing.assert_allclose(p.gradient, 2.0)

        In the above example, the gradient could easily be computed by hand;
        however, .backward() can be used to differentiate through any DCP
        program (that is also DPP-compliant).

        This method uses the chain rule to evaluate the gradients of a
        scalar-valued function of the variables with respect to the parameters.
        For example, let x be a variable and p a parameter; x and p might be
        scalars, vectors, or matrices. Let f be a scalar-valued function, with
        z = f(x). Then this method computes dz/dp = (dz/dx) (dx/p). dz/dx
        is chosen to be the all ones vector by default, corresponding to
        choosing f to be the sum function. You can specify a custom value for
        dz/dx by setting the .gradient attribute on your variables. For example,

        ::

            import cvxpy as cp
            import numpy as np


            b = cp.Parameter()
            x = cp.Variable()
            quadratic = cp.square(x - 2 * b)
            problem = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(quadratic), [x >= 0])
            b.value = 3.
            problem.solve(requires_grad=True, eps=1e-10)
            x.gradient = 4.
            problem.backward()
            # dz/dp = dz/dx dx/dp = 4. * 2. == 8.
            np.testing.assert_allclose(b.gradient, 8.)

        The .gradient attribute on a variable can also be interpreted as a
        perturbation to its optimal value.
