def log_det_canon(expr, args):
    """Reduces the atom to an affine expression and list of constraints.

    Creates the equivalent problem::

       maximize    sum(log(D[i, i]))
       subject to: D diagonal
                   diag(D) = diag(Z)
                   Z is upper triangular.
                   [D Z; Z.T A] is positive semidefinite

    The problem computes the LDL factorization:

    .. math::

       A = (Z^TD^{-1})D(D^{-1}Z)

    This follows from the inequality:

    .. math::

       \det(A) >= \det(D) + \det([D, Z; Z^T, A])/\det(D)
               >= \det(D)

    because (Z^TD^{-1})D(D^{-1}Z) is a feasible D, Z that achieves
    det(A) = det(D) and the objective maximizes det(D).

    Parameters
    ----------
    expr : log_det
    args : list
        The arguments for the expression

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
