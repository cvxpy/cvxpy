def construct_intermediate_chain(problem, candidates, gp=False):
    """
    Builds a chain that rewrites a problem into an intermediate
    representation suitable for numeric reductions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem : Problem
        The problem for which to build a chain.
    candidates : dict
        Dictionary of candidate solvers divided in qp_solvers
        and conic_solvers.
    gp : bool
        If True, the problem is parsed as a Disciplined Geometric Program
        instead of as a Disciplined Convex Program.

    Returns
    -------
    Chain
        A Chain that can be used to convert the problem to an intermediate form.

    Raises
    ------
    DCPError
        Raised if the problem is not DCP and `gp` is False.
    DGPError
        Raised if the problem is not DGP and `gp` is True.
