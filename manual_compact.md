# Label Feature Implementation Summary

## Current Status
We're implementing a label feature for CVXPY that allows custom names for expressions and constraints. Currently addressing PR review feedback.

## Key Issue Under Consideration
Should we implement `format_labeled()` for atoms that have custom `name()` methods? Initial analysis suggests most would benefit from custom implementations.

### Current Implementation
- **Have custom `format_labeled()`**: 
  - `AddExpression` - handles infix `+` for multiple args
  - `BinaryOperator` - handles infix `*`, `/` with precedence
  - `UnaryOperator` - handles negation `-`

- **Use default from Expression**: All other atoms

### Plan
See `atoms_analysis_output.txt` for case-by-case analysis. Planning to implement custom `format_labeled()` in phases:

**Phase 1**: High-priority atoms that clearly benefit
- Operations where label propagation significantly improves readability
- Infix and special notation cases

**Phase 2**: Additional atoms identified in analysis
- Function-style atoms that would look better with argument labels
- Operations commonly used in debugging

### Rationale
Most atoms with custom `name()` methods would actually look better with their own `format_labeled()` implementation to properly propagate labels from their arguments. Default implementation shows variable names, not labels, which defeats the purpose of the feature for debugging complex expressions.

### Next Steps
Work through atoms_analysis_output.txt case by case, implementing Phase 1 and Phase 2.
