CVXPY is a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems. It allows you to express your problem in a natural way that follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required by solvers.

For example, the following code solves a least-squares problem where the variable is constrained by lower and upper bounds:

```python3
import cvxpy as cp
import numpy

# Problem data.
m = 30
n = 20
numpy.random.seed(1)
A = numpy.random.randn(m, n)
b = numpy.random.randn(m)

# Construct the problem.
x = cp.Variable(n)
objective = cp.Minimize(cp.sum_squares(A @ x - b))
constraints = [0 <= x, x <= 1]
prob = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)

# The optimal objective is returned by prob.solve().
result = prob.solve()
# The optimal value for x is stored in x.value.
print(x.value)
# The optimal Lagrange multiplier for a constraint
# is stored in constraint.dual_value.
print(constraints[0].dual_value)
```

With CVXPY, you can model
* convex optimization problems,
* mixed-integer convex optimization problems,
* geometric programs, and
* quasiconvex programs.

CVXPY is not a solver. It relies upon the open source solvers
[ECOS](http://github.com/ifa-ethz/ecos), [SCS](https://github.com/bodono/scs-python),
and [OSQP](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/osqp). Additional solvers are
[available](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver),
but must be installed separately.

CVXPY began as a Stanford University research project. It is now developed by
many people, across many institutions and countries.


## Installation
CVXPY is available on PyPI, and can be installed with
```
pip install cvxpy
```

Please be respectful in your communications with the CVXPY community, and make sure to abide by our [code of conduct](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing
We appreciate all contributions. You don't need to be an expert in convex
optimization to help out.

You should first
install [CVXPY from source](https://www.cvxpy.org/install/index.html#install-from-source).
Here are some simple ways to start contributing immediately:
* Read the CVXPY source code and improve the documentation, or address TODOs
* Enhance the [website documentation](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/tree/master/doc)
* Browse the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues), and look for issues tagged as "help wanted"
* Polish the [example library](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/tree/master/examples)
* Add a [benchmark](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/tree/master/cvxpy/tests/test_benchmarks.py)

If you'd like to add a new example to our library, or implement a new feature,
please get in touch with us first to make sure that your priorities align with
ours. 

Contributions should be submitted as [pull requests](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/pulls).
A member of the CVXPY development team will review the pull request and guide
you through the contributing process.

Before starting work on your contribution, please read the [contributing guide](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Team
CVXPY is a community project, built from the contributions of many
researchers and engineers.

CVXPY is developed and maintained by [Steven
Diamond](https://stevendiamond.me/), [Akshay
