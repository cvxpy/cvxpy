Our `format_labeled()` implementation follows the same pattern as the `name()` implementation - just replacing `str()` calls with `.format_labeled()` calls. `AddExpr` needs special treatment for both `name` and `format_labeled` because CVXPY flattens additions like `x + y + z + d` into a single `AddExpression([x, y, z, d])` with 4 args.

 We've only added custom `format_labeled()` to the 3 classes that have special infix notation: `AddExpression`, `BinaryOperator` (for `*`, `/`), and `UnaryOperator` (for negation). Other atoms work fine with the default implementation. I've added tests in test_various_operations_with_labels that verify correct behavior for multi-arg operations (`vstack`, `hstack`), various norms (`norm1`, `norm_inf`, `pnorm`), and atoms with custom `name()` methods (`transpose`, `quad_form`, `power`, `index`, `geo_mean`).
