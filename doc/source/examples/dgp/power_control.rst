Power control
=============

*This example is adapted from Boyd, Kim, Vandenberghe, and Hassibi,* "`A
Tutorial on Geometric
Programming <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/gp_tutorial.pdf>`__."

*The problem data is adapted from the corresponding example in CVX's
example library (Almir Mutapcic).*

This example formulates and solves a power control problem for
communication systems, in which the goal is to minimize the total
transmitter power across n trasmitters, each trasmitting positive power
levels :math:`P_1`, :math:`P_2`, :math:`\ldots`, :math:`P_n` to
:math:`n` receivers, labeled :math:`1, \ldots, n`, with receiver
:math:`i` receiving signal from transmitter :math:`i`.

The power received from transmitter :math:`j` at receiver :math:`i` is
:math:`G_{ij} P_{j}`, where :math:`G_{ij} > 0` represents the path gain
from transmitter :math:`j` to receiver :math:`i`. The signal power at
receiver :math:`i` is :math:`G_{ii} P_i`, and the interference power at
receiver :math:`i` is :math:`\sum_{k \neq i} G_{ik}P_k`. The noise power
at receiver :math:`i` is :math:`\sigma_i`, and the signal to noise ratio
(SINR) of the :math:`i`\ th receiver-transmitter pair is

.. math::


   S_i = \frac{G_{ii}P_i}{\sigma_i + \sum_{k \neq i} G_{ik}P_k}.

The transmitters and receivers are constrained to have a minimum SINR
:math:`S^{\text min}`, and the :math:`P_i` are bounded between
:math:`P_i^{\text min}` and :math:`P_i^{\text max}`. This gives the
problem

.. math::


   \begin{array}{ll}
   \mbox{minimize} & P_1 + \cdots + P_n \\
   \mbox{subject to} & P_i^{\text min} \leq P_i \leq P_i^{\text max}, \\
   & 1/S^{\text min} \geq \frac{\sigma_i + \sum_{k \neq i} G_{ik}P_k}{G_{ii}P_i}
   \end{array}.
