Problem statement
=================

In this notebook, we'll tackle the problem of trying to protect a parade
route by placing a limited number of guards.

The parade route is discritized into :math:`m` points. There are
:math:`n` possible guard locations with associated decision variable
:math:`x \in  \lbrace 0,1\rbrace^n`, where :math:`x_i = 1` if and only
if a guard is placed at location :math:`i`. Associated with guard
location :math:`i` is a *coverage vector* :math:`a_i \in \mathbf{R}^m`,
which describes how well a guard placed at location :math:`i` would
'cover' each point in the parade route. We will assume that guard
coverage is additive, so that the vector describing the total coverage
of every edge is given by :math:`Ax`, where
:math:`A \in \mathbf{R}^{m \times n}` has :math:`a_i` as its
:math:`i`\ th column.

The parade route is only as secure as its least well-covered point. Our
goal is to place :math:`k` guards to maximize the minimum coverage over
the points in the route.

Optimization formulation
========================

We can formulate this as the optimization problem

\\[ ]

This problem is nonconvex and, in general, NP-hard due to the Boolean
decision variable.

Relaxation
==========

We can try to approach the problem with convex optimization by first
forming the convex relaxation

\\[ ] by constraining :math:`x \in [0,1]^n`.

In general, the solution to this problem, :math:`x^\star`, will have
fractional values. As we want a Boolean allocation, we can use an
`iterated weighted :math:`\ell_1`
heuristic <http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures/l1_ext_slides.pdf>`__
to try to recover a Boolean solution.

Iterated weighted :math:`\ell_1` heuristic
==========================================

To try and recover a Boolean solution, we will solve a sequence of
convex problems where we add a linear term :math:`-w^Tx` to the
objective, picking the weight vector :math:`w \in \mathbf{R}^n_+` at
each iteration to try and induce a sparse solution vector
:math:`x^\star`. The details can be found in the `Stanford EE364B
lecture
notes <http://stanford.edu/class/ee364b/lectures/l1_ext_slides.pdf>`__.

The algorithm consists of initializing :math:`w = 0` and repeating the
two steps

1. \\[ ]
2. Let :math:`w_i = \alpha/(\tau + x_i) \forall i`

until we reach a Boolean solution. Here, :math:`\alpha` and :math:`\tau`
are adjusted to promote a sparse solution. Typical choices would be
:math:`\alpha = 1` and :math:`\tau = 10^{-4}`.

Intuitively, the weight vector :math:`w` is incentivizing elements of
:math:`x` which were close to zero in the last iteration towards zero in
the next iteration.

Example
=======

We create a parade route in the unit square :math:`[0,1] \times [0,1]`
by generating points along a connected sequence of line segments.
Possible guard locations are a set of randomly placed points in the unit
square. Guards' coverage of points in the parade route is a function of
distance between the two points. We also add buildings in the unit
square to obstruct the guards' view. The guard has no effect on a point
if his line of sight is obstructed. We generate the :math:`A` matrix for
this problem instance below.

We perform the iterative algorithm below. At each step, we plot the
vector :math:`x`, demonstrating that it becomes increasingly sparse at
each iteration.

        objective = cp.Maximize(t - x.T*w)
        constr = [0 <=x, x <= 1, t <= A*x, cp.sum(x) == num_guards]
        cp.Problem(objective, constr).solve(verbose=False)
        x = np.array(x.value).flatten()
        w = 2/(tau+np.abs(x))
