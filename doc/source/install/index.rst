Install Guide
=============

Mac OS X
--------

The following instructions assume you already have Python installed.
CVXPY supports both Python 2 and Python 3.

1. Install the Command Line Tools for Xcode.

   Download from the `Apple developer site <http://developer.apple.com/downloads>`_.

2. If you don't have ``pip`` installed, follow the instructions `here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_ to install it.

3. Install ``numpy`` with ``pip`` from the command-line.

   ::

     pip install numpy

4. Install ``cvxpy`` with ``pip`` from the command-line.

   ::

       pip install cvxpy

5. Test the installation with ``nose``.

  ::

       pip install nose
       nosetests cvxpy

Ubuntu 14.04
------------

The following instructions are for installing CVXPY with Python 2.
To install CVXPY with Python 3, simply install the Python 3 version of all the packages.

1. Make sure ``apt-get`` is up-to-date.

  ::

      sudo apt-get update

2. Install ``ATLAS`` and ``gfortran`` (needed for ``SCS``).

   ::

       sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran

3. Install ``python-dev``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-dev

4. Install ``pip``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-pip

5. Install ``numpy`` and ``scipy``.

   ::

       sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy

6. Install ``cvxpy``.

   ::

       sudo pip install cvxpy

  or to install locally

   ::

      pip install --user cvxpy

7. Install ``nose``.

  ::

       sudo apt-get install python-nose

8. Test the installation with ``nose``.

  ::

       nosetests cvxpy

Windows
-------

Here is a step-by-step guide to installing CVXPY on a Windows machine.

1. If you have Python installed already, it's probably a good idea to remove it first. (Sorry!)

2. Download the latest version of Python(x,y).

3. Install Python(x,y). When prompted to select optional components, make sure to check cvxopt and cvxpy, as shown below.

  .. image:: files/windows1.png
      :scale: 100%

  .. image:: files/windows2.png
      :scale: 49%

4. To test the cvxpy installation,
open Python(x,y) and launch the interactive console (highlighted button in the picture).
This will bring up a console.

  .. image:: files/windows4.png
      :scale: 100%

5. From the console, run "nosetests cvxpy".
If all the tests pass, your installation was successful.

Other Platforms
---------------

The CVXPY installation process on other platforms is less automated and less well tested. Check `this page <https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/wiki/CVXPY-installation-instructions-for-non-standard-platforms>`_ for instructions for your platform.

Install from source
-------------------

CVXPY has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.4
* `setuptools`_ >= 1.4
* `toolz`_
* `CVXOPT`_ >= 1.1.6
* `ECOS`_ >= 1.0.3
* `SCS`_ >= 1.0.1
* `NumPy`_ >= 1.8
* `SciPy`_ >= 0.13

To test the CVXPY installation, you additionally need `Nose`_.

CVXPY automatically installs `ECOS`_, `CVXOPT`_, `SCS`_, and `toolz`_.
`NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_ will need to be installed manually. Once youâ€™ve
installed `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_, installing CVXPY from source is simple:

1. Clone the `CVXPY git repository`_.
2. Navigate to the top-level of the cloned directory and run

   ::

       python setup.py install

Install with GLPK support
-------------------------

CVXPY supports the GLPK solver, but only if CVXOPT is installed with GLPK bindings. To install CVXPY and its dependencies with GLPK support, follow these instructions:

1. Install `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_. We recommend either installing the latest GLPK from source or using a package manager such as apt-get on Ubuntu and homebrew on OS X.

2. Install `CVXOPT`_ with GLPK bindings.

    ::

      CVXOPT_BUILD_GLPK=1
      CVXOPT_GLPK_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/lib
      CVXOPT_GLPK_INC_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/include
      pip install cvxopt

3. Follow the standard installation procedure to install CVXPY and its remaining dependencies.


Install with GUROBI support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the GUROBI solver.
Simply install GUROBI such that you can ``import gurobipy`` in Python.
See the `GUROBI <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with Elemental support
------------------------------

CVXPY supports the Elemental solver.
Simply install Elemental such that you can ``import El`` in Python.
See the `Elemental <http://libelemental.org/>`_ website for installation instructions.
