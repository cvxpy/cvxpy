Install
=======

*Note*: Version 1.0 of CVXPY is incompatible with previous versions in minor
ways. See :ref:`updates` for how to update legacy code to a form that's
compatible with 1.0.

Mac OS X and Linux
------------------

CVXPY supports both Python 2 and Python 3 on OS X and Linux. We recommend using
Anaconda for installation, as we find that most users prefer to let Anaconda
manage dependencies and environments for them. If you are comfortable with
managing your own environment, you can instead install CVXPY with
:ref:`pip <pip-installation>`.

1. Install `Anaconda`_.

2. Install ``cvxpy`` with ``conda``.

   ::

      conda install -c conda-forge lapack
      conda install -c cvxgrp cvxpy

3. Test the installation with ``nose``.

  ::

       conda install nose
       nosetests cvxpy


Windows
-------

CVXPY supports Python 2 (with Anaconda and pip) and Python 3 (with pip) on Windows.
We recommend using
Anaconda for installation, as we find that most users prefer to let Anaconda
manage dependencies and environments for them. If you are comfortable with
managing your own environment or need Python 3, you can instead install CVXPY with
:ref:`pip <pip-installation>`.

1. Download and install the `latest version of Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_.

2. Download the `Visual Studio C++ compiler for Python <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266>`_.

3. Install CVXPY from the Anaconda prompt by running the following command:

  ::

      conda install -c conda-forge lapack
      conda install -c cvxgrp cvxpy

4. From the console, run ``nosetests cvxpy``.
If all the tests pass, your installation was successful.


Other Platforms
---------------

The CVXPY installation process on other platforms is less automated and less well tested. Check `this page <https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxpy/wiki/CVXPY-installation-instructions-for-non-standard-platforms>`_ for instructions for your platform.

.. _pip-installation:

Pip
----------------

CVXPY can be installed on all platforms with `pip`_. We recommend isolating
your installation in a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.
After activating the environment, simply execute:

  ::

      pip install cvxpy


Install from source
-------------------

CVXPY has the following dependencies:

* Python 2.7 or Python 3.4
* `setuptools`_ >= 1.4
* `toolz`_
* `six <https://pythonhosted.org/six/>`_
* `fastcache <https://github.com/pbrady/fastcache>`_
* `multiprocess`_
* `OSQP`_
* `ECOS`_ >= 2
* `SCS`_ >= 1.1.3
* `NumPy`_ >= 1.8
* `SciPy`_ >= 0.15

To test the CVXPY installation, you additionally need `Nose`_.

CVXPY automatically installs `OSQP`_, `ECOS`_, `SCS`_, `toolz`_, six, fastcache, and
`multiprocess`_. `NumPy`_ and `SciPy`_ will need to be installed manually,
as will `Swig`_ . Once youâ€™ve installed these dependencies:

1. Clone the `CVXPY git repository`_.
2. Navigate to the top-level of the cloned directory and run

   ::

       python setup.py install

Install with CVXOPT support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the `CVXOPT`_ solver.
Simply install CVXOPT such that you can ``import cvxopt`` in Python.
See the `CVXOPT`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with Elemental support
------------------------------

CVXPY supports the Elemental solver.
Simply install Elemental such that you can ``import El`` in Python.
See the `Elemental <http://libelemental.org/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with GUROBI support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the GUROBI solver.
Simply install GUROBI such that you can ``import gurobipy`` in Python.
See the `GUROBI <http://www.gurobi.com/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with MOSEK support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the MOSEK solver.
Simply install MOSEK such that you can ``import mosek`` in Python.
See the `MOSEK <https://www.mosek.com/>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with XPRESS support
---------------------------

CVXPY supports the XPRESS solver.
Simply install XPRESS such that you can ``import xpress`` in Python.
See the `XPRESS <http://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization-suite>`_ website for installation instructions.

Install with GLPK support
-------------------------

CVXPY supports the GLPK solver, but only if CVXOPT is installed with GLPK bindings. To install CVXPY and its dependencies with GLPK support, follow these instructions:

1. Install `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_. We recommend either installing the latest GLPK from source or using a package manager such as apt-get on Ubuntu and homebrew on OS X.

2. Install `CVXOPT`_ with GLPK bindings.

    ::

      CVXOPT_BUILD_GLPK=1
      CVXOPT_GLPK_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/lib
      CVXOPT_GLPK_INC_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/include
      pip install cvxopt

3. Follow the standard installation procedure to install CVXPY and its remaining dependencies.


Install with Cbc (Clp, Cgl) support
-----------------------------------
CVXPY supports the `Cbc <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_ solver (which includes Clp and Cgl) with the help of `cylp <https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP>`_.
Simply install cylp (you will need the Cbc sources which includes `Cgl <https://projects.coin-or.org/Cbc>`_) such you can import this library in Python.
See the `cylp documentation <https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP>`_ for installation instructions.
