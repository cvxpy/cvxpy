Install
=======

CVXPY supports Python 3 on Linux, macOS, and Windows. You can use
pip or conda for installation. You may want to isolate
your installation in a `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_,
or a conda environment.

.. card:: Instructions

    .. tab:: pip

        (Windows only) `Download <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16>`_ the Visual Studio build tools for Python 3
        (`instructions <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT-p04simYhorAdKstO9F1RK-k6npuyrKWliJ8Wy9uuQoQq_TiFdJA-DK3Kz0irkCEUlmNEH4JScbkwUflXv9c/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&resourcekey=0-HEezB2NFstz1GjKDkroJSQ&slide=id.p1>`_).

        (macOS only) Install the Xcode command line tools.

        (optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.

        Install CVXPY using `pip`_:

          ::

              pip install cvxpy

        You can add solver names as "extras"; `pip` will then install the necessary
        additional Python packages.

          ::

              pip install cvxpy[CBC,CVXOPT,GLOP,GLPK,GUROBI,MOSEK,PDLP,SCIP,XPRESS]

    .. tab:: conda

        `conda`_ is a system for package and environment management.

        (Windows only) Download the `Visual Studio build tools for Python 3 <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16>`_.

        1. Install `conda`_.

        2. Create a new conda environment,
          ::

              conda create --name cvxpy_env
              conda activate cvxpy_env

         or activate an existing one

        3. Install ``cvxpy`` from `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_
           ::

              conda install -c conda-forge cvxpy

    .. tab:: Install from source

        We strongly recommend using a fresh virtual environment (virtualenv or conda) when installing CVXPY from source.

        CVXPY has the following dependencies:

         * Python >= 3.7
         * `OSQP`_ >= 0.6.2
         * `CLARABEL`_ >= 0.6.0
         * `SCS`_ >= 3.0
         * `NumPy`_ >= 1.15
         * `SciPy`_ >= 1.1.0

        All required packages are installed automatically alongside CVXPY.

        Perform the following steps to install CVXPY from source:

         1. Clone the official `CVXPY git repository`_, or a newly minted fork of the CVXPY repository.
         2. Navigate to the top-level of the cloned directory.
         3. If you want to use CVXPY with editable source code, run
            ::

                pip install -e .

            otherwise, run
            ::

                pip install .

    .. tab:: Using Codespaces

        We provide support for `GitHub Codespaces <https://github.com/features/codespaces>`_ with
        preconfigured environments for CVXPY development via `devcontainers <https://containers.dev/>`_.
        To get started, click the "Code" button on the CVXPY repository and select "Open with Codespaces".

.. warning::
    Apple M1 users have had trouble installing CVXPY using the commands above.
    That trouble stemmed partly from a configuration error in CVXPY's
    ``pyproject.toml``, which has been fixed in CVXPY 1.1.19 and 1.2.0.
    If you have those versions (or newer) then the above commands should
    work *provided* (1) you have ``cmake`` installed via Homebrew and (2)
    you have an ECOS 2.0.5 wheel. The cmake requirement stems from OSQP
    and there appear to be problems building more recent versions of ECOS on M1 machines.
    See `this comment <https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues/1190#issuecomment-994613793>`_
    on the CVXPY repo and
    `this issue <https://github.com/embotech/ecos-python/issues/33>`_ on the ECOS repo
    for more information.


Install with Additional Solver Support
------------------------------------

.. info:: CVXOPT and GLPK
    :collapsible: open

    CVXPY supports the `CVXOPT`_ solver.
    Additionally, through CVXOPT, CVXPY supports the `GLPK`_ solver. On `most
    platforms <https://cvxopt.org/install/index.html#installing-a-pre-built-package>`_,
    `CVXOPT`_ comes with GLPK bundled. On such platforms, installing CVXOPT with

      ::

          pip install cvxopt

    should suffice to get support for both CVXOPT and GLPK.

    On other platforms, to install CVXPY and its dependencies with GLPK support, follow these instructions:

    1. Install `GLPK <https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/>`_. We recommend either installing the latest GLPK from source or using a package manager such as apt-get on Ubuntu and homebrew on OS X.

    2. Install `CVXOPT`_ with GLPK bindings.

        ::

          CVXOPT_BUILD_GLPK=1
          CVXOPT_GLPK_LIB_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/lib
          CVXOPT_GLPK_INC_DIR=/path/to/glpk-X.X/include
          pip install cvxopt

    3. Follow the standard installation procedure to install CVXPY and its remaining dependencies.

    Simply install cylp and the corresponding prerequisites according to the `instructions <https://github.com/coin-or/CyLP#cylp>`_, such you can import this library in Python.

.. info:: COPT
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the COPT solver.
    Simply install COPT such that you can ``import coptpy`` in Python.
    See the `COPT <https://github.com/COPT-Public/COPT-Release>`_ release page for installation instructions.

.. info:: CPLEX
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the CPLEX solver.
    Simply install CPLEX such that you can ``import cplex`` in Python.
    See the `CPLEX <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P>`_ website for installation instructions.

.. info:: SDPA
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the SDPA solver.
    Simply install SDPA for Python such that you can ``import sdpap`` in Python.
    See the `SDPA for Python <https://sdpa-python.github.io/docs/installation>`_ website for installation instructions.

.. info:: SDPT3
   :collapsible:

    The `sdpt3glue package <https://github.com/TrishGillett/pysdpt3glue>`_ allows you to model problems with CVXPY and solve them with SDPT3.

.. info:: NAG
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the NAG solver.
    Simply install NAG such that you can ``import naginterfaces`` in Python.
    See the `NAG <https://support.nag.com/numeric/py/nagdoc_latest/readme.html>`_ website for installation instructions.

.. info:: GLOP and PDLP
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the GLOP and PDLP solvers. Both solvers are provided by
    the open source `OR-Tools <https://github.com/google/or-tools>`_ package.
    Install OR-Tools such that you can run ``import ortools`` in Python. OR-Tools
    version 9.3 or greater is required.

.. info:: SCIP
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the SCIP solver through the ``pyscipopt`` Python package.
    See the `PySCIPOpt <https://github.com/SCIP-Interfaces/PySCIPOpt#installation>`_ github for installation instructions.

    CVXPY's SCIP interface does not reliably recover dual variables for constraints. If you require dual variables for a continuous problem, you will need to use another solver. We welcome additional contributions to the SCIP interface, to recover dual variables for constraints in continuous problems.

.. info:: SCIPY
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the SCIPY solver for LPs and MIPs.
    This requires the `SciPy`_ package in Python, which should already be installed, as it is a requirement for CVXPY.
    `SciPy`_'s "interior-point" and "revised-simplex" implementations are written in Python and are always available.
    However, the main advantage of this solver is its ability to use the `HiGHS`_ LP and MIP solvers (which are written in C++).
    `HiGHS`_ LP solvers come bundled with `SciPy`_ version 1.6.1 and higher.
    The `HiGHS`_ MIP solver comes bundled with version 1.9.0 and higher.

.. info:: PIQP
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the PIQP solver.
    Simply install PIQP such that you can ``import piqp`` in Python.
    See the `PIQP <https://predict-epfl.github.io/piqp/interfaces/python/installation>`_ website for installation instructions.

.. info:: PROXQP
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY supports the PROXQP solver.
    Simply install PROXQP such that you can ``import proxsuite`` in Python.
    See the `proxsuite <https://github.com/simple-robotics/proxsuite#quick-install>`_ github for installation instructions.
    Be aware that PROXQP by default uses dense matrices to represent problem data.
    You may achieve better performance by setting ``backend = 'sparse'`` in your call to ``problem.solve``.

.. info:: Without default solvers
   :collapsible:

    CVXPY can also be installed without the default solver dependencies.
    This can be useful if the intention is to only use non-default solvers.

    The solver-less installation, ``cvxpy-base``, can currently be installed through pip and conda.

    Installing using pip:

    .. code-block:: python

        pip install cvxpy-base

    Installing using conda:

    .. code-block:: python

        conda install cvxpy-base

Running the test suite
------------------------------------
CVXPY comes with an extensive test suite, which can be run after installing `pytest`_.
If installed from source, navigate to the root of the repository and run

.. code-block:: python

    pytest

To run the tests when CVXPY was not installed from source, use

.. code-block:: python

    pytest --pyargs cvxpy.tests
