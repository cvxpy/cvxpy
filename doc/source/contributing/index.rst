We welcome all contributors to CVXPY. You don't need to be an expert in convex
optimization to help out. For detailed instructions, please read our
`contributing guide

Your should first install CVXPY from :doc:`source </install/index>`. Here are
simple ways to start contributing immediately:

If you'd like to add a new example to our library, or implement a new feature,
please get in touch with us first by opening an issue to make sure that your
priorities align with ours.
