Citing CVXPY
============

If you use CVXPY for published work, we encourage you to cite the accompanying
`JMLR MLOSS paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxpy_paper.pdf>`_
and the `JCD paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxpy_rewriting.pdf>`_.
Please use the following BibTeX citations:

::

    @article{cvxpy,
      author  = {Steven Diamond and Stephen Boyd},
      title   = {{CVXPY}: A {P}ython-Embedded Modeling Language for Convex Optimization},
      journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},
      year    = {2016},
      volume  = {17},
      number  = {83},
      pages   = {1--5},
    }

      volume    = {13},
      issue     = {5},
      pages     = {961--976},
    }

If you use CVXPY's support for disciplined quasiconvex programming, please
cite the `accompanying paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dqcp.html>`_
and use the following BibTeX citation:
