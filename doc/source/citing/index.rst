Citing CVXPY
============

If you use CVXPY for published work, we encourage you to cite the accompanying
`JMLR MLOSS paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxpy_paper.pdf>`_
and the `JCD paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/cvxpy_rewriting.pdf>`_.
Please use the following BibTeX citations:

::

    @article{cvxpy,
      author  = {Steven Diamond and Stephen Boyd},
      title   = {{CVXPY}: A {P}ython-Embedded Modeling Language for Convex Optimization},
      journal = {Journal of Machine Learning Research},
      year    = {2016},
      volume  = {17},
      number  = {83},
      pages   = {1--5},
    }

::

    @article{cvxpy_rewriting,
      author  = {Akshay Agrawal and Robin Verschueren and Steven Diamond and Stephen Boyd},
      title   = {A Rewriting System for Convex Optimization Problems},
      journal = {Journal of Control and Decision},
      year    = {2018},
      volume  = {5},
      number  = {1},
      pages   = {42--60},
    }

If you use CVXPY's support for disciplined geometric programming, please
cite the `accompanying paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dgp.html>`_
and use the following BibTeX citation:

      author  = {Akshay Agrawal and Steven Diamond and Stephen Boyd},
      title   = {Disciplined Geometric Programming},
      journal = {arXiv},
      archivePrefix = {arXiv},
      eprint = {1812.04074},
      primaryClass = {math.OC},
      year    = {2018},
    }


If you use CVXPY's support for disciplined quasiconvex programming, please
cite the `accompanying paper <https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dqcp.html>`_
and use the following BibTeX citation:
