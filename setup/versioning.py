# IMPORTANT NOTE
#
#   Our versioning infrastructure is adapted from that used in SciPy v 1.9.0.
#   Specifically, much of this content came from
#   https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/91faf1ed4c3e83afe5009ffb7a9d18eab8dae683/tools/version_utils.py
#   It's possible that our adaptation has unnecessary complexity.
#   For example, SciPy might have certain contingencies in place for backwards
#   compatibilities that CVXPY does not guarantee.
#
#   Some comments in the SciPy source provide justification for individual code
#   snippets. We have mostly left those comments in-place, but we sometimes preface
#   them with the following remark:
#      "The comment below is from the SciPy code which we repurposed for cvxpy."
