# Player 1 wishes to choose u to minimize his expected payoff u'Pv, while
# player 2 wishes to choose v to maximize u'Pv, where P is the payoff
# matrix, u and v are the probability distributions of the choices of each
# player (i.e. u>=0, v>=0, sum(u_i)=1, sum(v_i)=1)
# LP formulation:   minimize    t
#                       s.t.    u >=0 , sum(u) = 1, P'*u <= t*1
#                   maximize    t
#                       s.t.    v >=0 , sum(v) = 1, P*v >= t*1

# Input data

m = 12

# Variables for two players

## ISSUE: THEY AREN'T EXACTLY EQUAL FOR SOME REASON!
