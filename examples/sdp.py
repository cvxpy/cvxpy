This script finds a PSD matrix that is closest to a given symmetric,
real matrix, as measured by the Frobenius norm. That is, for
a given matrix P, it solves:
   minimize   || Z - P ||_F
   subject to Z >= 0

Adapted from an example provided in the SeDuMi documentation and CVX examples.
Unlike those examples, the data is real (not complex) and the result is only
required to be PSD (instead of also Toeplitz)
