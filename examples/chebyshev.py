# The goal is to find the largest Euclidean ball (i.e. its center and
# radius) that lies in a polyhedron described by linear inequalites in this
# fashion: P = { x : a_i'*x <= b_i, i=1,...,m } where x is in R^2

# Create the problem

# variables
radius = Variable(1)
center = Variable(2)

# constraints
a1 = cvxopt.matrix([2,1], (2,1))
a2 = cvxopt.matrix([2,-1], (2,1))
a3 = cvxopt.matrix([-1,2], (2,1))
a4 = cvxopt.matrix([-1,-2], (2,1))

b = cvxopt.matrix(1, (4,1))


constraints = [ a1.T*center + np.linalg.norm(a1, 2)*radius <= b[0],
				a2.T*center + np.linalg.norm(a2, 2)*radius <= b[1],
				a3.T*center + np.linalg.norm(a3, 2)*radius <= b[2],
				a4.T*center + np.linalg.norm(a4, 2)*radius <= b[3] ]


# objective
objective = Maximize(radius)

p = Problem(objective, constraints)
# The optimal objective is returned by p.solve().
result = p.solve()
# The optimal value
print radius.value
print center.value
# Convert to 1D array.
center_val = np.asarray(center.value[:,0])


# Now let's plot it
x = np.linspace(-2, 2, 256,endpoint=True)
theta = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)

# plot the constraints
plot( x, -x*a1[0]/a1[1] + b[0]/a1[1])
plot( x, -x*a2[0]/a2[1] + b[0]/a2[1])
plot( x, -x*a3[0]/a3[1] + b[0]/a3[1])
plot( x, -x*a4[0]/a4[1] + b[0]/a4[1])


# plot the solution
