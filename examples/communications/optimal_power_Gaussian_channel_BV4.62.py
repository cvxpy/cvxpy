Optimal power and bandwidth allocation in a Gaussian broadcast channel.

We consider a communication system in which a central node transmits messages
to n receivers. Each receiver channel is characterized by its (transmit) power
level Pi ≥ 0 and its bandwidth Wi ≥ 0. The power and bandwidth of a receiver
channel determine its bit rate Ri (the rate at which information can be sent)
via
   Ri=αiWi log(1 + βiPi/Wi),
where αi and βi are known positive constants. For Wi=0, we take Ri=0 (which
is what you get if you take the limit as Wi → 0).  The powers must satisfy a
total power constraint, which has the form
P1 + · · · + Pn = Ptot,
where Ptot > 0 is a given total power available to allocate among the channels.
Similarly, the bandwidths must satisfy
W1 + · · · +Wn = Wtot,
where Wtot > 0 is the (given) total available bandwidth. The optimization
variables in this problem are the powers and bandwidths, i.e.,
P1, . . . , Pn, W1, . . . ,Wn.
The objective is to maximize the total utility, sum(ui(Ri),i=1..n)
where ui: R → R is the utility function associated with the ith receiver.
