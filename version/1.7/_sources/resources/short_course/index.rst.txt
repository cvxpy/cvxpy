CVXPY Short Course
==================

Convex optimization is simple using CVXPY.
We have developed a 
`short course <https://www.cvxgrp.org/cvx_short_course/docs/index.html>`_
that teaches how to use Python and CVXPY,
explains the basics of convex optimization,
and covers a variety of applications.
